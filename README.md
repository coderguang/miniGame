# miniGame
A miniGame lib,about server and client,server will use c++ and mongodb,client may use unity3D

about server:
	server now is a c++ lib ,a simple c++ lib ,include thread ,socket , datetime ,log,smartPoint etc. you can start from GameProject/Test/,this has many test code when I build this project. it can easy to start a C/S model. a simple rpc is support,and a simple timer can be use. a tools for generate struct ,rpc serialize code also can be use,which I call it csgl base on flex and bison.

v103:  csgl tools in Engine/tools/csgl to build csgl tools ,your onlye need run "make all"

how to start: enter dir GameEngine/Test,run "sh mlib",it will build static lib. after then ,run "make all",it build Test exec.
